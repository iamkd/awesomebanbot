# Awesome Ban Bot
**It in pre-pre-alpha, so expect the ugliest code you've ever seen üòè**

A bot that does ban, kick and mute the way it is meant to be.

# Usage
Add [@AwesomeBanBot](https://t.me/AwesomeBanBot) to your group chat. Grant it admin rights. And it works!

Reply to any message with:
* `/ban` ‚Äì triggers a vote to ban the user.
* `/mute` ‚Äì triggers a vote to mute the user
* **Core feature that does not fully work for now**

  `/spam` ‚Äì triggers a vote to ban the user for spam. In case of ban decision it removes all his messages and puts him into a spammer list. This list will provide spammer detection to other group chats that use this bot.

# Roadmap
There is a ton of things to do and I've decided to track them in [Github Issues](https://github.com/iamkd/awesomebanbot/issues). Everything will appear there soon.
